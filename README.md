A simple python bot to take advantage of earnbucks referrals. Incorporates Faker and Selenium to create fake profiles and register them for any given referral link.
### How to run

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Faker](https://pypi.org/project/Faker/), [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/), and [Chrome Web Driver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) are required.

```sh
$ python bot.py
$ Please input referral link: *your link here*
$ How many registrations would you like to complete: *your choice here*
```

Then the program will run for your required length with random time intervals between 30-90 seconds in between each process.
